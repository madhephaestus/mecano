/**
 * Read-only interface for a spatial acceleration.
 * <p>
 * A spatial acceleration is a vector composed of 6 components with an angular part and a linear
 * part. It represents the time derivative of a twist. The angular part represents a 3D angular
 * acceleration and the linear part a 3D linear acceleration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A spatial acceleration always describes the relative velocity of a body with respect to a base.
 * These two entities are referred to here by using two reference frames: a {@code bodyFrame} that
 * is considered to be rigidly attached to the body, and a {@code baseFrame} that is considered to
 * be rigidly attached to the base.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When using a {@code SpatialAccelerationVectorReadOnly}, it is important to note that the
 * reference frame in which it is expressed does not only refer to the coordinate system in which
 * the angular and linear 3D vectors are expressed. The origin of the reference frame is also used
 * as the point where the acceleration is measured. While the angular part remains the same as the
 * point of measurement changes, the linear part does depend on its location.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This framework for representing in an accurate and safe manner spatial accelerations is based on
 * the Ph.D. thesis of Vincent Duindam entitled <i>"Port-Based Modeling and Control for Efficient
 * Bipedal Walking Robots"</i>. Duindam's publications can be found
 * <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/vincentduindam/publications">here</a>. Several references
 * to this work are spread throughout the code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The convention when using a spatial vector in matrix operations is that the angular part occupies
 * the 3 first rows and the linear part the 3 last as follows:<br>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     / angularX \
 *     | angularY |
 *     | angularZ |
 * V = | linearX  |
 *     | linearY  |
 *     \ linearX  /
 * </pre>
